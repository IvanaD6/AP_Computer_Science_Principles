# How To...Create an Appropriate Heading

### At minimum, a heading should include:
* Your full name.
* The assignment name.
* The date.

**Use markdown to professionally format your heading.**

For example, an appropriate heading for your first AP Classroom reflection might look like...

<br>

> ## A. Student - AP Classroom Assignment 01 Reflection - Binary Numbers
> Wednesday, September 13th 2024

<br>

The markdown code to create this heading would look like...

```markdown
## A. Student - AP Classroom Practice Set 01 Reflection - Binary Numbers
Wednesday, September 13th 2024
```
