### Decentralization, DNS, IP Addresses, and Bandwidth

**AIM:** How do devices connect with and communicate with eachother over The Internet?


**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61XT.7</ins>: Describe how computer systems and networks work.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I have deepened my understanding of what it means for The Internet to be decentralized.
- [ ] I have deepened my understanding of what it means for the Internet to have open protocols.
- [ ] I can describe what IP addresses are and how they are assigned to devices, as well as the difference between IPv4 and IPv6.
- [ ] I can explain what domain names are and identify the parts of a domain name.
- [ ] I can explain what bandwidth is and explain how limited bandwidth impacts users.

    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
    1.  Search for and open the 'Task Manager' on your device.<br>
    2.  From the left menu bar, select 'Performance'.<br>
    3.  Select 'Ethernet' from the left menu bar.<br>
    4.  Resize the window so that it takes up half of your screen. <br>
    5.  In a separate window, open a web browser.<br>
    6.  Resize the web browser window so that it takes up the other half of the screen.<br>
    7.  Surf the web!<br><br>
    What do you notice?

**AGENDA:**
1. Bandwidth Exploration
2. Revisiting Decentralization
3. Revisiting Open Protocols
3. How Does The Internet Actually Work?
4. The Domain Name System (DNS)
5. IP Addresses
6. Check for Understanding
7. AP Classroom Practice (HW Headstart)
