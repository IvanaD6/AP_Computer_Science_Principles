### Fault Tolerance

**AIM:** In what ways can we ensure a device or connection failure does not lead to a network failure?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENTS**:<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.7</ins> Describe how computer systems and networks work.<br> 

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can describe how redundancy keeps networks "up and running" even when devices or connections fail.
- [ ] I can analyze the fault tolerance of a network.
