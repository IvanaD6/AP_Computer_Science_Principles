### Parallel and Distributed Computing

**AIM:** In what ways can we improve efficiency when executing large computing tasks?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENTS**:<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.7</ins> Describe how computer systems and networks work.<br> 

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can explain the difference between sequential computing solutions and parallel computing solutions.
- [ ] I can identify whether a set of tasks is best executed using a sequential computing solution or a parallel computing solution.
- [ ] I can describe how to allocate processors to maximize parallel computing efficiency.
- [ ] I can calculate the minimum amount of time it will take for a set of processors working in parallel to complete a set of tasks.
- [ ] I can calculate the time saved by implementing a parallel computing solution vs. a sequential computing solution.

  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b>
    <br> You are your friend have been hired to paint four rooms in an apartment...<br><br>
      The first room is large and will take 3 hours to paint.<br>
      The second room isd small and will only take 2 hours to paint.<br>
      The third room is also small, but has many complex corners.  So, it will take 4 hours to paint.<br>
      The fourth room is large, and it also has complex corners.  So, will take 8 hours to paint.<br><br>
      With a partner, plan a fair way to share the workload.  In other words, who will paint which rooms?<br>
      <b>Write down your plan in your notes and be prepared to share.</b>
    </td>
    </tr>

**AGENDA:**

1. Painting Plan Shareout
2. Sequential vs. Parallel Tasks
* **Sequential:**<br>
(1) Buy Paint
(2) Prep Room
(3) Paint
* **Parallel:**<br>
(1) Paint Room 1
(2) Paint Room 2
(3) Paint Room 3
3. Sequential vs. Parallel Computing
5. Allocating Tasks to Maximize Efficiency of Parallel Computing Solutions
6. Calculating Minimum Processing Time to Complete Tasks in Parallel.
7. Calculating Time Saved by Implementing a Parallel Computing Solution vs. a Sequential Computing Solution.
8. Practice (AP Classroom)
