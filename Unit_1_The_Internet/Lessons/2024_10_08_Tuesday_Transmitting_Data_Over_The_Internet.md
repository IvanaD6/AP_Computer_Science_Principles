### Transmitting Data Over The Internet

**AIM:** How does information travel through the internet?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENTS**:<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.5</ins> Communicate effectively as a Computer Scientist.<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.7</ins> Describe how computer systems and networks work.<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.8</ins> Model employability skills such as personal mindset, and collaboration.<br>

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can describe how information flows through the Internet as a datastream of packets that are numbered and re-ordered.
- [ ] I can explain how this process can allow for large messages to reliably be sent even if packets are dropped or arrive out of order.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b>
    <br> <ins>Read</ins> the instructions for the whole-group internet simulation activity. Be prepared to verbally explain the directions (popcorn-style).
    </td>
    </tr>
</table>

**AGENDA:**

1. Do now share out
2. Datastream simulation (whole-group)
3. Simulation Debrief
4. Putting it all together (Vocabulary)

**DATASTREAM SIMULATION**
<br><br>*A <ins>simulation</ins> is an imitation of a process*
<br><b>Objective: Get the data from the sender to the receiver</b>
1. We will designate a sender and receiver on opposite ends of the room (volunteers)
2. The data will be broken down into pieces, and sent across the room one piece at a time
3. The data will travel by being passed from person to person. The only rules are that...
  <br>a. Each person can only hold one piece at a time
  <br>b. No one can move from their seat
5. When the pieces arrive to the receiver, the receiver takes note of the order the pieces arrived in
6. The receiver puts the data back together.
7. Repeat, but this time with two pairs of senders/receivers. 

**SIMULATION DEBRIEF**
<br><br>Turn and talk to a partner about the following questions. <ins>Be prepared to share</ins>: 
- Did all of the pieces in your sent data always follow the same path?
- Did every piece arrive in the correct order? Was the receiver still able to put the data back together?
- What if one or more of the pieces didnt arrive? How would the receiver still be able to put the data back together?
- What kind of information can we include with each piece to make this process smoother between the sender and receiver?

**PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER (VOCABULARY)**
<br><ins>Make sure to get these down in your notes as we talk about them</ins>
- Network
- Packets & their characteristics
  - Metadata
- Datastream
- Protocol
