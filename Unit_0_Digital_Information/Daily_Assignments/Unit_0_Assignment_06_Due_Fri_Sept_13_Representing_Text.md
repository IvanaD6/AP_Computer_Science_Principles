2. Use the partial ASCII table below to convert your short phrase or sentence to a sequence of decimal numbers.
3. Convert your short sequence of decimal numbers to a sequence of bits.<br>**Be sure to save your work converting from decimal to binary.  You will need it for part 3 of this assignment.**

**This sequence of bits is how a computer would represent your short phrase or sentence!**
