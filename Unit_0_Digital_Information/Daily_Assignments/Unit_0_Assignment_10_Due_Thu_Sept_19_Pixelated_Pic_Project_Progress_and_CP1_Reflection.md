Due: Thursday, September 19th 2024

## Part 1
1. Review your results from Unit 0 Checkpoint 1.
2. Create and submit a reflection document titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_Unit_0_Checkpoint_1_Reflection.md`<br>*Need help creating and submitting a reflection document?

## Part 2
Complete the grid of pixels that you started during today's class. 

**DIRECTIONS:**

Now that you have digitized your pixelated pic, your next step is to create a grid of pixels in binary form by converting each color to binary!  Follow the steps below to create a grid of pixels in binary form:

1. Download [Pixelated Pic Project - Binary Pixels.docx](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles/blob/main/Unit_0_Digital_Information/Projects/Pixelated_Pic_Project/Pixelated%20Pic%20Project%20-%20Binary%20Pixels.docx) to your Computer Science portfolio directory on your device.
2. Open `Pixelated Pic Project - Binary Pixels.docx` on your device and type your name and the date in the heading.
3. Convert the top left pixel to binary form.  To accomplish this...
    *  Convert the Red value to a byte (i.e. an 8-bit binary bitstring)
    *  Convert the Green value to a byte (i.e. an 8-bit binary bitstring)
    *  Convert the Blue value to a byte (i.e. an 8-bit binary bitstring)
    *  Append the 3 bitstrings together to form a single 24-bit bitstring.
    *  Capture your work using copies of the graphic organizer provided in class. To download and print extra copies of the graphic organizer, [click here](https://github.com/MrJSwotinsky/AP_Computer_Science_Principles/blob/main/Unit_0_Digital_Information/Projects/Pixelated_Pic_Project/Pixelated%20Pic%20Project%20-%20Graphic%20Organizer.pdf).

4. Repeat for all other pixels.
5. Save your file, convert it to a PDF, and upload it to your pixelated pic project folder on GitHub.  Remember to include an appropriate commit message.
6. Scan your work into a single document, convert it to an appropriately named PDF, and upload it to your pixelated pic project folder on GitHub.  Remember to include an appropriate commit message.
