### Lossless Compression

**AIM:** In what ways can we save storage space and reduce transmission times?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking skills to a variety of tasks.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can apply byte pair encoding to compress data in a way that it can be restored to its original form.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>
      List a few abbreviations you have used when you have sent a text message.  For example, LOL = Laughing Out Loud.
    </tr>
</table>

**AGENDA:**

1. Abbreviation Share Out
2. Why Do We Bother To Abbreviate?
3. Compression
4. [A Few Words From Aloe Blacc](https://studio.code.org/s/text-compression/lessons/1/levels/2)
