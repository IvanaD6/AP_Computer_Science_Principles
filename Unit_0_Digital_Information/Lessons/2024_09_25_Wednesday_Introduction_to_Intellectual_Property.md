**WHAT DO WE MEAN BY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY?**
- When you create materials on the computer, you own them - they are your "Intellectual Property".
- Using materials created by someone else and trying to pass them off as your own is plagiarism when you don't have the creator's permissions.
- There may even be legal consequences for using these materials!
- It can be complicated when we talk about ownership of digital information.

**TURN & TALK**
<br>Imagine you created an image and you posted it online for your friends to see - but, a week later you find out someone took that image and put it on a T-shirt that theyâ€™re selling for $10 each. What strikes you as fair or unfair? How could this be more fair? 


**COPYRIGHT**
- Copyright is one way to assert ownership over your intellectual property.
- When you create something new, copyright law automatically gives you full ownership rights in your creation.
- Copyright gives creators economic and artistic control over their intellectual property. 
- In our digital age, where we can consume, create, and reshare all kinds of creative work (books, software, movies, music, images, games, songs, etc), it is important for us to know the rules of the road for getting and sharing creative work legally and ethically. 
- Just because something is easy (like downloading and sharing files) doesn't mean it is legally okay. 

**LEGAL IMPLICATIONS**
<br>The use of material created by someone else without permission and persentented as one's own is plagiarism and may have legal consequences. Measures should be taken to safeguard intellectual property.

**CREATIVE COMMONS & MORE**
<br> Some examples of legal ways to use materials created by someone else include: 
- <b>Creative Commons (CC)</b>: A public copyright license that enables the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. This is used when the content creator wants to give the entire world the right to share, use, and build upon the work they have created (ex. Wikipedia, Khan Academy). 
    - Advantages: The creator gets exposure, Spreading a collaborative spirit
    - Disadvantages: Creator cannot monetize *(make money off of)* their work the same way
- <b>Open Source:</b> Programs that are made freely available and may be redistributed and modified. Usually refers to software.
    - Advantages: Free, you can build off of someone else's work instead of starting from scratch, vibrant community of developers
    - Disadvantages: Not proprietary.
- <b>Open Access:</b> Online research results that are free of any and all restrictions on access and free of many restrictions on use, such as copyright<br>
- <b>Fair Use:</b> States that it is allowed to use limited portions of a work including quotes, for purposes such as commentary, criticism, news reporting, and scholarly reports, without getting permission from the creator first
- <b>Public Domain:</b> The public domain consists of all the creative work to which no exclusive intellectual property rights apply. Those rights may have expired, been forfeited, expressly waived, or may be inapplicable. Because no one holds the exclusive rights, anyone can legally use or reference those works without permission.
<br><br><ins>These have all enabled broad access to digital information. When you use these materials, always make sure to cite where you go these sources. Citations come in many forms - it could be a link, or a description of where you got the source. </ins>
