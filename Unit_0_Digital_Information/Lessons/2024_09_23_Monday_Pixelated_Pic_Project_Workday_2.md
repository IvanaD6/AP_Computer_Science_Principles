### Pixelated Pic Project Workday 2

**AIM:** How can I finalize and reflect on my work for the pixelated pic project?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking skills to a variety of tasks.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I have completed all parts of the pixelated pic project.  Specifically...
    - [ ] I have sketched a pixelated pic.
    - [ ] I have created a digital version of my pixelated pic sketch.
    - [ ] I have created a grid of pixels to represent my pixelated pic sketch, **and shown all my work**.
    - [ ] I have created a binary string to represent my pixelated pic sketch.
    - [ ] I have converted my binary string to a digital version of my pixelated pic sketch using the python program I have been provided.
    - [ ] I have organized my work appropriately in my GitHub portfolio.
    - [ ] I have thoroughly reflected on my work.
- [ ] I can describe the advantages and disadvantages of lossy and lossless compression.

  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW: Make a plan...</b><br>
    Write down the first item you plan to work on during today's class period.(For example, I will organize the work I have submitted so far in my GitHub portfolio.)<br> 
    Write down the next task you plan to complete during today's class period. (For exmaple, I will finish completing the pixel grid for my pixelated pic project.)<br>
    Write down a task you plan to start working on if you have additional time after you have compelted the two tasks you identified above.<br>
    <b>Be prepared to share your responses</b>
