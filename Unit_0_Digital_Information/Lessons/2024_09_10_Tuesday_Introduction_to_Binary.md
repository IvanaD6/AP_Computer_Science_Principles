### Introduction to Binary

**AIM:** What is binary and in what ways do computing devices use binary to store and share data?

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT:**
<br><ins>IEC.TYS61XT.2</ins>: Apply computational thinking skills to a variety of tasks.

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I can convert between binary and decimal numbers.
- [ ] I can apply binary conversions to contextualized applications.
- [ ] Given a binary number, I can determine the next sequential binary number.
- [ ] I can determine the impact of appending 0's to the end of a bitstring.
- [ ] I can explain what it means to say that computing devices use binary numbers to represent ALL data.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>DO NOW:</b><br><br>Sketch two different symbols each of which represents something different.<br><br><i>For example...
      <ul>
        <li>A circle that has been shaded in to represent "Power On" and a circle that has not been shaded in to "Power Off"
        <li>A smiley face to represent "Happy" and a sad face to represent "Not Happy",
        <li> etc.
      </ul>
    <b>Be Creative!</b> 
  </tr>
</table>

**AGENDA:**

1. Symbol Share Out
2. What is Binary and What is it Used to Represent?
3. Decimal <--> Binary Conversion
4. Contextualized Applications
5. Determining the Next Sequential Binary Number
6. Appending 0's to Bitstrings
7. AP Classroom Practice Sets and Reflections

**WHAT IS BINARY AND WHAT IS IT USED TO REPRESENT:**

**Key Points:**
* Binary sequences are sequences composed of 0's and 1's.
* Each 0 or 1 in a binary sequence is known as a bit. *Ex/ The first bit in the binary sequence, 10111011, is 1.*
* A sequence of of 8 bits is known as a byte. *Ex/ The binary sequence, 10111011 is a byte because it contains 8 bits.*
* Binary sequences are also known as bitstrings.
* Binary is the language of computing devices.  In other words, computing devices use binary to store and share ALL data (numbers, text, images, videos, audio recordings, files, applications, etc.)
* To a computing device, the symbol, 0, represents "Off" and the symbol, 1, represents "On"

**DECIMAL <--> BINARY CONVERSIONS:**

Example 1/ Convert 150 from decimal to binary.

Example 2/ Convert 10100101 from binary to decimal.

**CONTEXTUALIZED APPLICATIONS:**

Example 3/ The table below demonstrates how a particular computer program represents the directions on a compass:

|Direction|Binary Value|
|---|---|
|North|1000|
|Northeast|1010|
|East|0010|
|Southeast|0110|
|South|0100|
|Southwest|0101|
|West|0001|
|Northwest|1001|

Which direction is represented by the decimal value, 6?

**DETERMINING THE NEXT SEQUENTIAL BINARY NUMBER:**

Example 4/ What is the next sequential binary number after 10011100?

Example 5/ What is the next sequential binary number after 11101001?

Example 6/ What is the next sequential binary number after 10010111?

**APPENDING 0's to BITSTRINGS**

Example 7/ What is the impact of appending 0 to the end of a bitstring?

Example 8/ What is the impact of appending three 0's to the end of a bitstring?
