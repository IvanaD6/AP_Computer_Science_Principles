### Emoji Project Workday #1

**AIM(s):** <br>
How can I use comments to organize my code and start coding a first draft of my emoji project? <br><br>

**OUTCOME ALIGNMENT**:<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.3</ins> Code using appropriate programming logic.<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.4</ins> Code using appropriate syntax.<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.5</ins> Communicate effectively as a Computer Scientist.<br> 
<ins>TYS61XT.6</ins> Engage in the design thinking process to iteratively develop your work.<br> 

**SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] I have written comments to outline my code
- [ ] I have started coding a first draft of my emoji project
- [ ] I have received and recorded one piece of feedback from a peer.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>DO NOW:</b><br>
      1. Make or open your project code file <br>
      2. Use comments (as you would bullet points) to start listing out all the different elements you need to code for your project.<br>
      For example, If I were coding a cat, my code file would look like this: <br><br>
      #Head<br>
      #Eyes<br>
      #Ears<br>
      #Whiskers<br>
      ...etc.
</td>
</tr>
</table>

**AGENDA:**
1. Do Now Share Out
2. Finish writing an outline of your project using comments
    - Consider: Are my elements listed in the proper order? (Remember, lines of code are run in order. If you are coding different layers, the bottom layers need to be coded before the top layers)
3. Start a first draft of your project
    - Under each comment, start writing the code for that element.
4. Get and record one piece of feedback from a peer

**HOMEWORK:**
1. Work on your project, making at least 3 commits. For one of your commits, implement the feedback you got from your peer at the end of class.
2. In your commit message, include <b>who</b> gave you the feedback and <b>what</b> the feedback was.
