# Unit 2, Assignment 2: Lab 1 - Intro to CMU Graphics
Due: Tuesday, October 22nd 2024

Create a new python file in your Physical Device > AP CSP Portfolio folder titled, LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab1_Intro_to_CMU_Graphics.py, and complete the following lab:

1.  Copy/paste the following starter code into your file.

```python
# Import the CMU Graphics package:
from cmu_graphics import *


# Run program:
cmu_graphics.run()
```

**Use the open space between `from cmu_graphics import *` and `# Run program:` to complete the rest of this lab**

2. Use comments code comments to respond to the following prompts.  Remember, code comments start with the `#` symbol and end at the end of the line.

* In your own words describe what code comments are.
    * What symbol is used to denote code comments?
    * What purpose do code comments serve?
    * What does Python do when it sees a code comment?
* In your own words, describe what the CMU Graphics canvas is.
    * Explain how x values are measured on the CMU Graphics canvas?
    * Where is x = 0 located?
    * Where is x = 400 located?
    * Explain how y values are measured on the CMU Graphics canvas?
    * Where is y = 0 located?
    * Where is y = 400 located?
 * What does the arguments in the `Rect()` function represent?
    * What does the first argument represent?
    * What does the second argument represent?
    * What does the third argument represent?
    * What does the fourth argument represent? 
  
3. Code an image composed of at least 5 rectangles.  Remember to include descriptive code comments for each rectangle.  For excample, "small center rectangle", "short wide rectangle", "top right rectangle", etc.  The comments you write should describe the rectangles you code.
4. Save and run your file.
5. Capture a screenshot of your image, title it `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab1_Intro_to_CMU_Graphics.tif`, and save it to the AP CSP Portfolio on your desktop.
6. Upload both `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab1_Intro_to_CMU_Graphics.py` and `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab1_Intro_to_CMU_Graphics.tif` to your GitHub portfolio > Labs folder.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>CAUTION: Do not proceed to step 7 until after you have uploaded BOTH files to your GitHub portfolio > Labs folder.</b></td>
  </tr>
</table>

7. Find a way to improve your image.  For example, you could rearrange your rectangles to create a simple, but recognizable image, you could add some rectangles to create a pattern, or you could do something else altogether. It is up to you!
8. Save and run your file. <br>(**Use the same file name** - `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab1_Intro_to_CMU_Graphics.py`)
9. Capture a screenshot of your image and save it to the AP CSP Portfolio on your desktop. <br>(**Use the same file name** - `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab1_Intro_to_CMU_Graphics.tif`)
10. Upload both `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab1_Intro_to_CMU_Graphics.py` and `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab1_Intro_to_CMU_Graphics.tif` to your GitHub portfolio > Labs folder. <br> **For each commit, write a message that briefly describes what you did to improve your image.**
