# Unit 2, Assignment 6: Lab 3 - Gradients
Due: Thursday, October 24th 2024

Create a new python file in your Physical Device > AP CSP Portfolio folder titled, `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab3_Gradients.py`, and complete the following lab:

1.  Copy/paste the following starter code into your file.

```python
# Import the CMU Graphics package:
from cmu_graphics import *


# Run program:
cmu_graphics.run()
```

**Use the open space between `from cmu_graphics import *` and `# Run program:` to complete the rest of this lab**

2. Use comments code comments to respond to the following prompts.  Remember, code comments start with the `#` symbol and end at the end of the line.

* How many parameters does the `gradient()` function take? What do they represent?
* What does the argument passed to the `start` parameter in the `gradient()` function represent?
  
3. Code an image composed of at least 5 rectangles of various fills, using gradients for at least 3 of them.  Remember to include descriptive code comments for each rectangle.
* Use 2 colors for at least one gradient.
* Use 3 or more colors for at least one gradient
* Represent at least one color in your gradient using its RGB triplet.
4. Save and run your file.
5. Capture a screenshot of your image, title it `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab3_Gradients.tif`, and save it to the AP CSP Portfolio on your desktop.
6. Upload both `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab3_Gradients.py` and `LastNameFirstInitial_U2_Lab3_Gradients.tif` to your GitHub portfolio > Labs folder.
