**Course Description:** AP Computer Science Principles 1 is the first semester in a two-semester sequence. Together, AP Computer Science Principles 1 and 2 serve as the 3rd and 4th of 8 Computer Science courses required for the CTE Computer Science pathway at Inwood Early College. AP Computer Science Principles is designed to introduce you to a broad range of topics in the field of Computer Science. Through a variety of projects, you will learn to evaluate and solve problems by designing, coding, and debugging your own programs. You will also have the opportunity to examine how computing shapes our society by investigating topics such as the Internet, cybersecurity, data privacy, the digital divide, and other ethical issues in Computer Science. After successful completion of this course, you will not only be prepared for further exploration of topics in Computer Science. You will also be able to apply the skills you have learned to a variety of different contexts. This course is also designed to prepare you for the AP Computer Science Principles Exam.

**Course Outcomes:** Upon successful completion of this course, you will be able to...

* Engage in **safe, ethical, and legal computing** practices.
* Apply **computational thinking** skills to a variety of tasks.
* Code using appropriate **programming logic**.
* Code using appropriate **syntax**.
* **Communicate** effectively as a Computer Scientist.
* Engage in the **design thinking** process to iteratively develop your work.

**AP Exam:** At the end of the year, you will have the opportunity to earn college credit and/or receive advanced placement in college by sitting for, and earning a qualifying score on, the AP Computer Science Principles exam. Exam scores range from 1 to 5. Generally, for AP Computer Science Principles, most colleges consider a 3, 4, or 5 to be a qualifying score. ***However, each college sets its own policy.***

**The AP Computer Science Principles exam consists of two sections together which assess your learning in relation to the Big Ideas and Topics below:**

**Section 1: End-of-Course Multiple-Choice Exam:**
* 70 multiple-choice questions on exam day | 120 minutes
* 70% of total score

**Section 2: Create Performance Task and Written Response:**
* Create Performance Task program code, video, and personalized project reference completed prior to the exam | 9 hours in-class + additional time to work outside of class.
* 2 written-response questions on exam day | 60 minutes
* 30% of total score

Create performance task program code, video, and Personalized Project Reference | 9 hours in-class
2 written response questions | 60-minute end-of-course exam

*The Create Performance Task is a project you will work on throughout the course of the year.*

**Work-based Learning Requirement:** For this course you are required to complete and log a minimum of 10 work-based learning hours.

**Grading Policy:** Throughout the semester, you will have the opportunity to show what you know through a variety of tasks including, but not limited to: labs, projects, checkpoints, and exams.

Each task will be aligned to one or more course outcomes. You will receive a separate score for each outcome indicating your progress toward mastery of that particular outcome. Your final score for each outcome will be the weighted average of all scores aligned to that particular outcome. Your final grade for the course will be determined using a weighted average of your final outcome scores.

***Note:*** You are NOT expected to demonstrate perfection in this course. You ARE expected to demonstrate **GROWTH!** As such, you will be given many opportunities to reflect on, and revise your work based on the feedback you receive. It is expected that you will take advantage of this opportunity by engaging in the feedback, reflection, revision cycle. ***Students who consistently engage in this process often see significant improvement in their grades.***
